# Clientele Policy

## Overview

At Willowgreen Digital Ventures, we're all about creating solid, beneficial relationships with our clients. If there's ever a snag in our partnership:

1. We'll work together to get things back on track and ensure it's beneficial for both parties.
2. If it seems a better fit lies elsewhere, we'll gladly suggest other services that could meet our client's needs more effectively.

Our goal is always to keep things positive and fair for everyone involved.

## Preferred Clientele Guidelines

* **Organizations with lean decision-making processes.** We appreciate engaging with partners who can facilitate smooth workflows. Our experience has found that smaller organizations, less regulated industries, and businesses with more agile structures typically foster faster and more efficient decision-making.
* **Clients who value fair pricing.** We pride ourselves on delivering high-quality services at competitive rates. Therefore, we seek partnerships with clients who appreciate and acknowledge the value and quality of our work rather than focusing primarily on cost negotiations.
* **Clients with clear objectives.** Our goal is to help our clients succeed, and to do that effectively, it helps when clients have a certain level of clarity about their goals. If clients are uncertain about their needs, we are more than happy to offer consultations, but an established sense of direction can greatly expedite the process.
* **Clients who demonstrate consistency in their requirements.** While we acknowledge that business needs can evolve, it's beneficial for both parties when clients maintain consistent objectives and requirements throughout our partnership. This allows us to better cater to your needs and provide the most value.
* **Clients who communicate professionally and courteously.** We believe in a respectful and professional work environment. As such, we appreciate partnering with clients who share the same ethos and encourage positive interactions.
* **Partnerships with shared ethical values.** We hold certain core values in high esteem. Our most productive collaborations tend to be with organizations that resonate with these values, fostering a foundation of mutual understanding and respect.
* **Focus on non-defense related industries.** Our organization has strategically chosen to devote our expertise to sectors not involved in defense contracting. This specialization enables us to provide significant value and make impactful contributions where our skills best align.
* **Industries with positive societal impact.** We aim to work with clients who contribute to society in positive ways. Therefore, we tend to avoid partnerships with industries often associated with potentially harmful societal effects.
